Base Case: No trains, no scheduling
1 train, scheduled to station 0

Inductive hypothesis:
Given that for k train arrivals, greedyTrain is able to find the lowest
number of stations needed to facilitate all trains.

Inductive Step: 
Assume that the solution k + 1 trains, our algorithm does NOT give the 
optimal sol.

We know for k trains our solution was optimal. for the next train that 
is arriving, if our solution is any worse than the optimal solution, it 
must append this train to a new track. But our algorithm can only do that 
if all tracks are currently occupied. At the same time, it is impossible 
for the optimal solution to append this new track to an existing 
station since they are all full. therefore: optimal solution and the 
greedyTrain algorithm is the same.
